# Smart-Security-Cam

It's really a fun project.By this you can make your regular webcam smart and cool ðŸ˜Ž.
The security.py will run your webcam (or any other cam connected with your device) and using OpenCv "harcascade" to detect any human face.
While any strange is in your home, it'll automatically start recording. After that the it'll run the Email.py and send the previously recorded video to your "Email".
So you don't have to worry about monitoring your house anymore, this smart system will always keep you updated.

Furthermore there are immense ways to develop this project. I'll keep updating as much as I can. Feel free to use it and make it more useful.

Thanks.
